## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (recommended)
  - OR Node.js (v20 or higher) + PostgreSQL 18

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

> **Important**: TriviaForge requires **TWO containers** to run:
> 1. `triviagame-app` - The Node.js application (pulls from Docker Hub)
> 2. `triviagame-db` - PostgreSQL 18 database (pulls from Docker Hub)
>
> You **MUST** use docker-compose to start both containers together.

**Choose your preferred setup method:**

#### Option A: Command Line (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:EmanTemplar/TriviaForge.git
   cd TriviaForge
   ```

2. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Configure environment variables BEFORE starting**

   Create your `.env` file from the template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   **Now open the `.env` file in a text editor and configure these REQUIRED settings:**

   ```env
   # REQUIRED: Set your admin password (login won't work without this!)
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

   # Optional: Server URL for QR codes (can also be set in Admin > Settings tab)
   # SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000

   # Optional: Set your host IP (helps with network detection)
   HOST_IP=192.168.1.100  # Replace with YOUR actual IP
   ```

   Find your IP address:
   - **Windows**: Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt (look for IPv4 Address)
   - **Mac/Linux**: Run `ifconfig` or `ip addr` in Terminal

   **Do not proceed until you've set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your .env file!**

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will:
   - Pull `postgres:18` from Docker Hub
   - Pull `emancodetemplar/triviaforge:latest` from Docker Hub
   - Start the database and wait for it to be healthy
   - Initialize the database schema automatically (takes 30-60 seconds)
   - Start the application

4. **Verify startup**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f app
   ```

   Wait for these success messages:
   - `✅ Database connection established`
   - `✅ Database initialization completed successfully`
   - `Server running on port 3000`

5. **Access the application**
   - Landing Page: `http://localhost:3000` (or use your SERVER_URL)
   - Admin Panel: `http://localhost:3000/index.html`
   - Use the ADMIN_PASSWORD you set in your .env file

#### Option B: Docker Desktop UI

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:EmanTemplar/TriviaForge.git
   cd TriviaForge
   ```

2. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Configure .env file FIRST**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Open `.env` in a text editor and set at minimum:
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password`
   - `SERVER_URL=http://YOUR_IP:3000`
   - `HOST_IP=YOUR_IP`

   (See Option A step 2 for details)

3. **Start via Docker Desktop**
   - Open Docker Desktop
   - Open a terminal in the TriviaForge directory
   - Run: `docker-compose up -d`
   - OR drag the project folder into Docker Desktop (if supported)

4. **Monitor in Docker Desktop UI**
   - Go to **Containers** tab
   - You should see both containers running:
     - `triviagame-app`
     - `triviagame-db`
   - Click on `triviagame-app` to view logs
   - Wait for: `Server running on port 3000`

5. **Access the application**
   - Landing Page: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Use the ADMIN_PASSWORD from your .env file

#### Common Docker Commands

**View logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f        # All services
docker-compose logs -f app    # Just the application
docker-compose logs -f db     # Just the database
```

**Stop the application:**
```bash
docker-compose down           # Stop and remove containers
docker-compose down -v        # Also remove database volume (fresh start)
```

**Restart after changes:**
```bash
docker-compose restart        # Restart existing containers
docker-compose up -d          # Recreate containers if needed
```

### Upgrading an Existing Install (Postgres 15 → 18)

Starting with this release, `docker-compose.yml` moves from `postgres:15` to `postgres:18`. The official Postgres 18 image also changed its data volume layout, so it will **refuse to start** against a volume initialized by Postgres 15/16/17 — this is expected, not a bug, and no data is destroyed by the failed start.

If you have an existing deployment with real data, back up and migrate before pulling this update:

1. **On your current (pre-upgrade) install**, go to Admin → Settings → Database Backups and click **Create Backup**. It's also worth clicking **Download** to keep a copy outside the container as a safety net, but it isn't strictly required — the backup file lives in the separate `backups` Docker volume, not `pgdata`, so it survives step 2 untouched.

2. **Stop the stack and remove only the old Postgres volume:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker volume rm <project>_pgdata   # e.g. triviagame_pgdata — check `docker volume ls`. Do NOT remove the `backups` or `uploads` volumes.
   ```

3. **Pull and start the updated stack** (this initializes a fresh, empty Postgres 18 volume and lets the app run its normal schema migrations):
   ```bash
   docker-compose pull
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Restore your backup** — go to Admin → Settings → Database Backups, find the backup from step 1 in the list, and click **Restore**. The app applies it and restarts automatically.

If you're running a fresh install with no existing data, skip all of this — Postgres 18 will initialize normally.

### Manual Setup (Without Docker)

1. **Install PostgreSQL 18**
   - Follow [PostgreSQL installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

2. **Create database**
   ```bash
   createdb trivia
   psql trivia < app/init/tables.sql
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**

   Create `.env` file in `app` directory:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/trivia
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
   APP_PORT=3000
   ```

5. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Quiz

#### Method 1: Manual Creation (Admin Panel)
1. Navigate to the Admin panel
2. Enter admin password
3. Fill in quiz title and description
4. Add questions with 2-10 answer choices
5. Mark the correct answer for each question
6. Click "Save Quiz"

#### Method 2: Excel Import
1. Download the Excel template from the Admin panel
2. Fill in your quiz data following the template format:
   - Column A: Question text
   - Columns B-K: Answer choices (2-10 choices)
   - Column L: Correct answer index (0-9)
   - Column M (optional): the round the question belongs to. If any question has a round, all must. Add a second sheet named `Rounds` (title in column A, time limit in seconds in column B, blank = untimed) to set the order and time limits of the rounds
3. Upload the completed Excel file

A ready-made round quiz to try is in [app/testing/samples/round-quiz-sample.xlsx](app/testing/samples/round-quiz-sample.xlsx) (13 questions in three rounds: 60 s, untimed and 90 s).
4. Review and save the imported quiz

### Running a Live Session

1. **Presenter Setup**
   - Open the Presenter page
   - Select a quiz from the dropdown
   - Click "Make Live" to create a room
   - Share the room code or QR code with players

2. **Player Join**
   - Players open the Player page
   - Enter room code and their name
   - Wait for questions to be presented

3. **Presenting Questions**
   - Navigate through questions using Previous/Next buttons
   - Click "Present Question to Players" to show current question
   - Players submit their answers
   - Click "Reveal Answer" to show correct answer and results

4. **Completing the Session**
   - Click "Complete Quiz & Save Results" to finish
   - Session data is automatically saved

<!-- Screenshot Placeholder: Live Session Flow -->
![Live Session in Progress](screenshots/live-session.png?v=202602)

### Resuming an Interrupted Session

If a session is interrupted (server restart, connection loss, etc.). Live sessions are saved every 2 minutes and again when the server shuts down normally (`docker compose restart`, `docker stop`, Ctrl+C), so only a crash can leave a resumed session up to 2 minutes behind:

1. Go to Presenter or Admin page
2. Find the session in "Resume Session" or "Incomplete Sessions" dropdown
3. Click "Resume"
4. The session comes back with its **original room code** (existing QR codes and links keep working) and is saved over the original session, not as a new one
5. Players rejoin with their **original names** to restore their progress
6. Continue from where you left off

<!-- Screenshot Placeholder: Resume Session -->
![Resume Session Feature](screenshots/resume-session.png?v=202602)

### Viewing Past Sessions

All completed and interrupted sessions are saved and can be reviewed:

1. Navigate to the Admin panel
2. Scroll to the "Completed Sessions" section
3. View session details including:
   - Quiz title and room code
   - Start/resume timestamps
   - Player names and scores
   - Individual question results

## Testing

TriviaForge includes a comprehensive automated testing suite for validating functionality and performance.

### Quick Test

```bash
# Windows
test.bat quick

# Linux/Mac
./test.sh quick
```

### Available Test Scenarios

**Quick Tests** (Development)
- `quick` - Fast validation (3 players) - ~10s
- `session` - Default test (5 players, 3 questions) - ~25s
- `verbose` - Detailed logging - ~25s

**Stress Tests** (Performance)
- `light` - Light load (5 players) - ~25s
- `medium` - Medium load (15 players) - ~45s
- `heavy` - Large event simulation (25 players) - ~2min
- `extreme` - Maximum capacity (50 players) - ~3min
- `stress` - Standard stress (20 players) - ~1min

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run default test
test.bat

# Run specific scenario
test.bat heavy

# View all options
test.bat help
```

### Custom Test Configuration

Set environment variables for custom scenarios:

```bash
# Example: 30 players, 10 questions
docker-compose exec -e TEST_PLAYERS=30 app node testing/test-runner.js
```

### Rounds Tests

Run these from `app/`:

- `npm run test:component`: podium ties, round components, the admin round handlers and which rooms are saved on shutdown. No server needed.
- `npm run test:rounds`: drives a running server over real Socket.IO connections (presenter, players, display) through a two-round quiz and checks answer leaks, timer expiry, reconnects, resume and persistence. About 30 seconds.
- `npm run test:e2e`: exercises the real player, presenter, display and admin pages in headless Chrome (needs Chrome).

The last two run against a server you start yourself: set `TEST_BASE_URL` and `TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and run the server with `DEBUG_MODE=true`, ideally on a scratch database. See [app/testing/README.md](app/testing/README.md) for setup.

**Available Environment Variables:**
- `TEST_PLAYERS` - Number of simulated players (default: 5)
- `TEST_QUIZ_ID` - Quiz to use (default: 1)
- `TEST_ANSWER_DELAY` - Max delay between answers in ms (default: 2000)
- `TEST_QUESTION_DELAY` - Delay between questions in ms (default: 5000)
- `TEST_VERBOSE` - Detailed logging (default: false)

## Environment Variables

### Configuration Methods

Environment variables can be set in multiple ways (listed by precedence, highest to lowest):

1. **Docker Desktop UI** - Set directly in the container configuration (highest priority)
2. **`.env` file** - Place in the root directory alongside `docker-compose.yml`
3. **Default values** - Built into `docker-compose.yml` (lowest priority)

### Available Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `APP_PORT` | Port number for the server | `3000` | No |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgres://trivia:trivia@db:5432/trivia` | Yes (auto-configured in Docker) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password to access admin panel | - | **Yes** |
| `HOST_IP` | Server IP address for network access | Auto-detected | No |
| `SERVER_URL` | Server URL for QR codes (can also be set in Admin > Settings) | Auto-detected | No |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT` | Session expiration time (ms) | `3600000` (1 hour) | No |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode (`development` or `production`) | `production` | No |
| `DEBUG_MODE` | Enable comprehensive debug logging (server-side) | `false` | No |
| `GUEST_ONLY_MODE` | Players join live games with just a display name (no usernames or accounts) | `false` | No |
| `SOLO_MODE` | Enable Solo Play (self-study without a presenter). When `false`, the Solo links, page and `/api/solo` endpoints are unavailable | `false` | No |
| `TZ` | Timezone for timestamps | `America/New_York` | No |
| `APP_NAME` | Application name | `TriviaForge` | No |
| `SOCKET_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | Socket.IO rate limit window (ms) | `60000` (1 min) | No |
| `SOCKET_JOIN_LIMIT` | Max join attempts per IP per window | `50` | No |
| `SOCKET_ANSWER_LIMIT` | Max answer submissions per IP per window | `300` | No |

### Important Notes

- **For Docker Desktop users:** Variables set in the UI will override `.env` file values
- **For Docker Compose CLI users:** Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and configure there
- **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`** must be set before first run for admin login to work
- **`SERVER_URL`** can be set in your `.env` file OR configured in the Admin > Settings tab. The Admin UI setting takes priority over the environment variable
