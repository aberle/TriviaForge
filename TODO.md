### 1. Fix Stay-Awake Notification on Mobile 📱
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH
**Completed:** 2026-01-01 (v4.2.2)
**Branch:** `player-improvements-v4`

**Issue:** Wake lock indicator not visible on mobile browsers (navbar space constraint)

**Problem:**
- Stay-awake/wake lock status badge showed on desktop but was completely hidden on mobile
- Mobile navbar had limited space, causing wake lock indicator to be cut off
- Specifically affected Android devices at ~1008px width (Brave browser)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed mobile breakpoint from 768px to 1024px to match hamburger menu threshold
- Room info section now wraps to two lines on mobile (≤1024px)
- Wake lock indicator (🔆) appears on its own line below room code and connection status
- Right-aligned and slightly larger (1.1rem) for better visibility
- Increased max-width to 140px for proper layout

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/components/player/PlayerNavbar.vue` - Added mobile-specific wrapping layout

**Testing:**
✅ Should now be visible on Android devices (~1008px width)
✅ Wraps to own line on mobile devices
✅ Desktop layout unchanged

---

### v5.2.0 Features - Session Management & 2FA ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH
**Completed:** 2026-01-30

---

## 📋 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Solo Play Score Persistence (FIXED in v5.9.0) ✅
- **Issue:** `gp.score` column in multiplayer game_participants was always 0
- **Fix:** saveSession() now computes correct answer count from player answers and persists to gp.score
- **Note:** Stats queries still use participant_answers for robustness (belt-and-suspenders approach)

---

## 📋 Long-term / Future Enhancements

> **Note:** These are planned features but not immediate priorities. See archived TODO-2025.md for detailed specifications.

### Database & Infrastructure
- [x] Database backup/restore strategy - v5.12.0 ✅
- [x] Backup file import — restore from a downloaded .sql.gz on a freshly rebuilt instance, since restore previously only worked on backups already present in the `backups` volume - v5.14.0 ✅
- [x] Database migration versioning - v5.1.0 ✅
- [x] Postgres 15 → 18 upgrade + Node 22 → 24 base image + safe npm dependency bumps - v5.13.0 ✅ (see README "Upgrading an Existing Install" for the required volume migration steps for existing deployments)
- [ ] Follow-up: major npm version bumps deferred from the dependency-update pass — express 5, pinia 4, vue-router 5, uuid 14 (also fixes a moderate CVE, GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq), csv-parse 7, archiver 8, @iconify/vue 5, dotenv 17, pdfkit 0.19. Each needs its own testing pass due to breaking API changes.
- [ ] Performance monitoring and query optimization
- [x] GitHub Actions - Docker Auto-Build & Push to Docker Hub - v5.11.0 ✅

### Security & User Management
- [ ] Implement Phase 1 security fixes from SECURITY-AUDIT.md (if not done)
- [ ] Ban Player Account system (permanent/temporary bans)
- [ ] Enhanced Player Security & Management (needs re-review post v3.2.1 improvements)
- [x] Multi-Admin Support System (isolated instances) - v5.0.0 ✅
- [x] Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP) for admins - v5.2.0 ✅
- [x] Remember device for 2FA (30-day trusted devices) - v5.9.0 ✅
- [ ] Email verification for admin accounts *(on pause — email hosting not yet configured)*

### Question Types & Media
- [x] True/False question type - v5.0.0 ✅
- [x] Question images (upload + URL reference) - v5.0.0 ✅
- [ ] Video/audio media support (future consideration)

### Player & Presenter Features
- [x] Automated Presenter Mode with Timers (auto-reveal, auto-advance) - v5.4.0 ✅
- [x] Solo-Play Mode for Players (self-study without presenter) - v5.4.0 ✅
- [x] Admin-Configurable Server URL for QR codes (replaces mDNS approach) - v5.7.0 ✅
- [x] Player-facing statistics dashboard with charts - v5.8.0 ✅

### Bug Investigations
- [x] Incorrect Answer Notification Bug — considered resolved; not observed since reconnection improvements ✅
- [ ] Socket.IO performance with large sessions (200+ concurrent players) *(eventual — low priority)*
